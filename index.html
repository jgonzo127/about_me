		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>I&#39m a newbie Front End web designer interested in learning as much as I can about the art of coding. The idea of combining design and content on something as powerful and frequently used as the web is fascinating to me. </p>
		
		<p>Working in the mysterious realm of the internet is an idea that dawned on me within the last year or so. I didn't realize how much time myself and everyone around me relied on the internet for so many things. Of course I need to learn how to make stuff on the internet!</p>
		
		<p>Friendship, stability, and hard work are all very important to me. I feel that one&#39s greatest challenge lies within one&#39s self, and overcoming that challenge is the most rewarding of lifelong goals.

	<h1>Where I&#39m From</h1>
	
		<p>I&#39m from the San Francisco Bay Area. I suppose it makes sense that I would be geared towards web development with all of the tech jobs and tech history so close to Silicon Valley! I have always loved living here and wouldn&#39t mind staying here long-term.</p>

	<h1>More About Me</h1>
	<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>

	    <p>I&#39m a big gamer for sure. I also <b>LOVE</b> food, movies, music, and Bay Area sports!</p>
		
      <h2>What&#39s your dream job?</h2>
	    
	    <p>I&#39d love to accumulate the required knowledge to make iphone or console games some day.</p>
		
      <h2>What&#39s your background?</h2>
	    
      <p>I&#39m an Academy of Art graduate. I attended school here in San Francisco studying computer animation with a focus on 3d modeling and texture art. I have some decent design experience from my studies there, and hope to apply what I have learned to front end design!</p>

      <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
	    
      <p>I&#39ve always been a big fan or rock music. I love everything from classic rock to more mellow alternative stuff like Radiohead, Bon Iver, and even some progressive rock and metal.</p>
